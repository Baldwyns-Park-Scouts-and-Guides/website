# Pre-commit Hooks

This repository uses pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality and consistency.

## What's Included

- **File formatting**: Removes trailing whitespace, ensures files end with newlines
- **Markdown linting**: Checks markdown files for consistency and best practices
- **TOML formatting**: Auto-formats Hugo configuration files
- **Hugo build check**: Ensures the site builds successfully
- **Conventional commits**: Enforces conventional commit message format

## Usage

Pre-commit hooks run automatically on every commit. To run them manually:

```bash
# Run on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run on staged files only
pre-commit run

# Skip hooks (not recommended)
git commit --no-verify
```

## Installation

Pre-commit is automatically installed in the devcontainer. For local development:

```bash
pipx install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
